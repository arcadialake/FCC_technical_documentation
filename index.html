      <header><b>Overview</b></header>
      <article>
      <p>Picture yourself in the era of discoveries: after a long voyage of great deprivation, your ships have finally reached the coast of an uncharted island. Its name shall be Catan! But you are not the only discoverer. Other fearless seafarers have also landed on the shores of Catan: the race to settle the island has begun!</p>
      <p><b>About the game</b>
<br>
The women and men of your expedition build the first two settlements. Fortunately, the yet uninhabited land is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too.</p>
      <p>To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea</p>
      <img id="catanoverview" src="https://www.catan.com/files/pageimages/dye_catan_150407_0564.jpg" alt="Catan board and setup">
      <p>Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements.</p>
<p>And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool.</p>
<p>We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents.</p>
        <p>Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game!</p>

      <header>Game Rules</header>
      <article>
      <p><b>Game Play:</b><br>Unless you're using the Starting Set-Up for Experienced Players, the oldest player goes first. On your turn, you can do the following in the order listed:
      <ul class="game-rules" id="game-play">
        <li>You must roll for resource production (the result applies to all players).</li>
        <li>You may trade resources with other players or using maritime trade.</li>
        <li>You may build roads, settlements or cities and/or buy Development Cards. You may also play one Development Card at any time during your turn.</li>
        <li>After you're done, pass the dice to the player to your left, who then continues the game with step 1.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p><b>Game Turn in Detail</b>
    <ol type="i" class="game-rules" id="game-turn">
      <li><b>Resource Production</b>
        <br><ul class="game-rules" id="resource-production">
          <li>You begin your turn by rolling both dice.</li>
          <li>The sum of the dice determines which terrain hexes produce resources.</li>
          <li>Each player who has a settlement on an intersection that borders a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives 1 Resource Card of the hex's type.</li>
          <li>If you have 2 or 3 settlements bordering that hex, you receive 1 Resource Card for each settlement.</li>
          <li>You receive 2 Resource Cards for each city you own that borders that hex.</li>
          <li>If there is not enough of a given resource in the supply to fulfill everyone's production, then no one receives any of that resource during that turn.</li>
        </ul>
      </li><br>
      <li><b>Trade</b>
        <p>Afterwards you may trade freely (using either or both types of trades below) to gain needed Resource Cards:</p>
        <ul class="game-rules" id="trade">
          <li><b>A. Domestic Trade</b><p>On your turn, you can trade Resource Cards with any of the other players. You can announce which resources you need and what you are willing to trade for them. The other players can also make their own proposals and counter offers.</p>
            <p><i>(Important: Players may only trade with the player whose turn it is. The other players may not trade among themselves.</i></p></li>
          <li><b>B. Maritime Trade</b>
            <p>You can also trade without the other players! During your turn, you can always trade at 4:1 by putting 4 identical Resource Cards back in their stack and taking any 1 Resource Card of your choice for it. If you have a settlement or city on a harbor, you can trade with the bank more favorably: at either a 3:1 ratio or in special harbors (trading the resource type shown) at 2:1.</p>
            <p><i>(Important: The 4:1 trade is always possible, even if you do not have a settlement on a harbor).</i></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Build</b>
        <p>Now you can build. Through building, you can increase your victory points, expand your road network, improve your resource production, and/or buy useful Development Cards.</p>
        <p>To build, you must pay specific combinations of Resource Cards (see the Building Costs Card). Take the appropriate number of roads, settlements, and/or cities from your supply and place them on the game board. Keep Development Cards hidden in your hand.</p>
        <p>You cannot build more pieces than what is available in your pool—a maximum of 5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads.</p>
        <ul class="game-rules" id="build">
          <li><b>A. Road requires: Brick & Lumber</b><ul>
            <li>A new road must always connect to one of your existing roads, settlements, or cities.</li>
            <li>Only 1 road can be built on any given path.</li>
            <li>The first player to build a continuous road (not counting forks) of at least 5 road segments, receives the Special Card "Longest Road".</li>
            <li>If another player succeeds in building a longer road than the one created by the current owner of the "Longest Road" card, he immediately takes the Special Card (and its 2 victory points). In this case, there is a 4 victory point swing!</li>
            </ul>
          </li><br>
          <li><b>B. Settlement requires: Brick, Lumber, Wool, & Grain</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Take special note of the "Distance Rule": you may only build a settlement at an intersection if all 3 of the adjacent intersections are vacant.</li>
              <li>Each of your settlements must connect to at least 1 of your own roads.</li>
              <li>Regardless of whose turn it is, when a terrain hex produces resources, you receive 1 Resource Card for each settlement you have adjacent to that terrain hex.</li>
              <li>Each settlement is worth 1 victory point.</li>
            </ul></li><br>
          <li><b>C. City requires: 3 Ore & 2 Grain</b>
            <ul>
              <li>You may only establish a city by upgrading one of your settlements.</li>
              <li>When you upgrade a settlement to a city, put the settlement (house) piece back in your supply and replace it with a city piece (church).</li>
              <li>Cities produce twice as many resources as settlements.</li>
              <li>You acquire 2 Resource Cards for an adjacent terrain hex that produces resources.</li>
              <li>Each city is worth 2 victory points.</li>
            </ul></li><br>
          <li><b>D. Buying Development Card (requires: Ore, Wool, & Grain)</b>
            <ul>
              <li>When you buy a Development Card, draw the top card from the deck.</li>
              <li>There are 3 different kinds of these cards: Knight; Progress; and Victory Point. Each has a different effect.</li>
              <li>Development Cards never go back into the supply, and you cannot buy Development Cards if the supply is empty.</li>
              <li>Keep your Development Cards hidden (in your hand) until you use them, so your opponents can't anticipate your play.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br><li><b>Special Cases</b>
      <p><b>A. Rolling a "7" and Activating the Robber</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you roll a "7", no one receives any resources.</li>
        <li>Instead, every player who has more than 7 Resource Cards must select half (rounded down) of his Resource Cards and return them to the bank.</li>
        <li>Then you must move the robber. Proceed as follows:
          <ol type="1">
            <li>You must move the robber immediately to the number token of any other terrain hex or to the desert hex.</li>
            <li>Then you steal 1 (random) Resource Card from an opponent who has a settlement or city adjacent to the target terrain hex. The player who is robbed holds his Resource Card hand face down. You then take 1 at random. If the target hex is adjacent to 2 or more players' settlements or cities, you choose which one you want to rob.</li>
          </ol></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <p><i>(Important: If the production number for the hex containing the robber is rolled, the owners of adjacent settlements and cities do not receive resources. The robber prevents it).</i></p>

      <p><b>B. Playing Development Cards</b></p>
    <p>At any time during your turn, you may play 1 Development Card (on the table). That card, however, may not be a card you bought during the same turn!</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Knight (aka "Soldier") Cards (Red Frame)</b>
          <ul><br>
            <li>If you play a Knight Card, you must immediately move the robber. See "Rolling a "7" and Activating the Robber" above and follow steps 1 and 2.</li>
            <li>Once played, Knight Cards remain face up in front of you.</li>
            <li>The first player to have 3 Knight Cards in front of himself receives the Special Card "Largest Army," which is worth 2 victory points.</li>
            <li>If another player has more Knight Cards in front of him than the current holder of the Largest Army card, he immediately takes the Special Card and its 2 victory points.</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li><b>Progress Cards (Green Frame)</b><br>
          <p>If you play a Progress Card, follow its instructions. Then the card is removed from the game (i.e., tossed in the box).</p>
          </p>
        </li>
    <li><b>Victory Point Cards (Yellow Frame)</b>
       <ul><br>
        <li>You must keep Victory Point Cards hidden.</li>
        <li>You may only reveal them during your turn and when you are sure that you have 10 victory points—that is, to win the game. Of course, you can reveal them after the end of the game when someone else wins.</li>
        <li>You may play any number of Victory Point Cards during your turn, even during the turn you purchase them.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    </p>
  <p><b>End of the Game</b></p>
  <p>If you have 10 or more victory points during your turn the game ends and you are the winner! If you reach 10 points when it is not your turn, the game continues until any player (including you) has 10 points on his turn.</p>

      <header><b>Playing Tips</b></header>
      <article>
      <p>I lost my first Catan game resoundingly. Well, nobody had told me that with two dice the numbers 6 and 8 are rolled much more frequently than the numbers 2 and 12. As you can imagine, I hardly received any resources for the settlement I had placed between terrain hexes marked with the numbers 2, 12, and 3. I wrote down a couple of tips for you, so you can avoid having a similar experience. I'll also give you a description of two variants I like to play.</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Probability of Rolling Certain Numbers</b>
          <p>If you roll 2 dice 36 times, the statistical distribution of the results is as follows:</p><br>
          <img src="http://mathfest.ca/mpf2013/probability_clip_image024.jpg" alt="Probabilities of two dice" id="dice_probability">

<p>This shows that the closer the numbers are to 7, the more frequently they are rolled. Therefore, at least at the beginning of the game you should build settlements adjacent to terrain hexes marked with numbers close to 7.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Diversity of Terrain Hexes</b><br>
          <p>You should make sure that your first two settlements are adjacent to all terrain types if possible. This is the only way to receive as many different resources as possible, thus avoiding expensive trades with the bank.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Diversity of Numbers</b><br>
          <p>A broad distribution of numbers is also beneficial. For example, owning a settlement adjacent to two terrain hexes marked with a 6 and an 8, respectively, is more favorable than owning a settlement adjacent to two terrain hexes each of which is marked with an 8.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Häfen</b>
          <p>Harbors are of particular importance if you can expect a good production of a particular resource.<br>
For example, if you have settlements adjacent to pasture hexes marked with good numbers, you should, as soon as possible, build a settlement on a coastal intersection next to the 2:1 wool harbor. Then you can trade 2 wool for any 1 other resource of your choice.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Trading</b>
          <p>If you trade cleverly, you improve your chances to win the game. Trading with an opponent gives you and your opponent an advantage over the other players. The less you trade, the more advantages you are giving away.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Complaining</b>
          <p>A little bit of complaining at the right time often works wonders. The likelihood of receiving better trade offers increases, and the robber avoids your terrain hexes. But don't overdo it!</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="variants">
      <header><b>Variants</b></header>
      <article>
      <p>The following variants are highly recommended:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><b>"Three Victory Points" Rule</b>
          <p>It is not allowed to place the robber on a terrain hex marked with a number if a player who has less than 3 victory points owns a settlement adjacent to this hex. At the beginning of the game, when all players still have less than 3 victory points, the robber must thus be placed on a hex that doesn't have a settlement adjacent to it. If this isn't possible, the robber stays in the desert.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Trade and Build in Any Order</b>
          <p>The "first trade, then build" order is no longer observed. The players may trade, then build, trade again, build again, etc.
If you play according to this variant, you also may immediately use a newly built harbor for maritime trade (trade with the bank at an improved rate).</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
